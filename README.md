## TEXTURE

A collection of python modules related with texture.

1.  upf.py
  This module allows to plot pole figures in any crystallographic structure
  from a discrete set of orientations. Look at the examples in ./ipynb/ folder.

2. bcc_rolling_fiber.py
   This module generates a set of 'ideal' fiber textures including 'gamma','alpha','eta','epsilon' and 'sigma'.
3. hcp_fiber.py
   A set of model basal-pole fibers for AZ31/ZE10 magnesium alloys   
4. cmb.py
   A tool to generate discrete orientation files from a discretly sampled COD in the Euler space.
5. cod_section.py
   A tool to visualize cod sections from directe orientation files
