TEXTURE
-------
A collection of python modules to analyze/plot crystallographic texture information. Below is the list of main modules included in this package, which can be very useful for those who study crystallographic texture / crystal plasticity and to plot the crystallographic data and to generate ideal textures on the basis of python/fortran codes.

1. upf.py
  This module allows to plot pole figures in any crystallographic structure from a discrete set of orientations. Look at the examples in ./ipynb/ folder. One can plot *pretty* pole figure plots and have a lot of options.
2. bcc_rolling_fiber.py
   This module generates a set of 'ideal' fiber textures including 'gamma','alpha','eta','epsilon' and 'sigma'. This module was used to create the set of BCC fibers studied in the paper entiled "Forming limit prediction using a self-consistent crystal plasticity framework: a case study for BCC fiber textures" submitted to Modelling and Simulations in Materials Science and Engineering.
3. hcp_fiber.py
   A set of model basal-pole fibers for AZ31/ZE10 magnesium alloys. This module has been used in a paper under preparation, that is entitled "Texture-based forming limit prediction for Mg sheet alloys ZE10 and AZ31".
4. cmb.py
   A tool to *sample* discrete orientation files from a discretly sampled COD in the Euler space. One can use this to extract the arbitrary number of discrete orientations from COD files generated by popLA.
5. cod_section.py
   A tool to visualize cod sections from directe orientation files


## Features
-----------
Plot beautiful pole figures from a population of discrete orientations (such as the texture input to VPSC code) using open source matplotlib
