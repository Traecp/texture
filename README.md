TEXTURE
-------
A collection of python modules to analyze/plot crystallographic texture information.
Below is the list of main modules included in this package, which can be very useful
for those who study crystallographic texture / crystal plasticity and those who
need to repeatedly plot/visualize the crystallographic data.
Also a few modules can be used to generate ideal model textures.
Source codes are written mostly in Python and a few modules are written in Fortran and wrapped by f2py.


1. upf.py
   This module can plot pole figures in any crystallographic structure from a discrete set of orientations.
   Look at the examples in ./ipynb/ folder.
   One can plot *pretty* pole figure plots and have a lot of options.
   (see also some example pole figures generated by this module in below)
   Compatible formats are:
   1. EPF (experimental pole figure formats used in popLA)
   2. VPSC texture (the collection of discrete orientations used in VPSC,EVPSC)
   3. Bruker's *.uxd file
2. bcc_rolling_fiber.py
   This module generates a set of 'ideal' fiber textures including 'gamma','alpha','eta','epsilon' and 'sigma'. This module was used to create the set of BCC fibers studied in the paper entiled "Forming limit prediction using a self-consistent crystal plasticity framework: a case study for BCC fiber textures" submitted to Modelling and Simulations in Materials Science and Engineering.
3. hcp_fiber.py
   A set of model basal-pole fibers for AZ31/ZE10 magnesium alloys. This module has been used in a paper under preparation, that is entitled "Texture-based forming limit prediction for Mg sheet alloys ZE10 and AZ31".
4. cmb.py
   A tool to *sample* discrete orientation files from a discretly sampled COD in the Euler space. One can use this to extract the arbitrary number of discrete orientations from COD files generated by popLA.
5. cod_section.py
   A tool to visualize cod sections from directe orientation files


## Features
-----------
Plot beautiful pole figures from a population of discrete orientations (such as the texture input to VPSC code).

Experimental pole figures are also drawn: example below is for the EPF format (a.k.a the popLA format).

Through this software one can generate model textures typically found in rolled sheets.
For example, a gamma fiber typically found in various mild steel sheets.
